# CHALLENGE CLIENT-SERVER API

Hello dev, how are you?

In this challenge we will apply what we learned about http webserver, contexts, database and file manipulation with Go.

You will need to give us two systems in Go:
- client.go
- server.go

The requirements to fulfill this challenge are:

- Client.go must make an http request to server.go requesting the dollar rate.

- The server.go must consume the api containing the dollar and real rate at the address: https://economia.awesomeapi.com.br/json/last/usd-brl and then return the result to the client in json format.

- Using the "context" package, server.go must register each dollar rate received in the SQLite database, with the maximum timeout to call the dollar rate api being 200ms and the maximum timeout to be able to persist the data in the database should be 10ms.

- Client.go will only need to receive the current dollar rate value from server.go ("bid" field in the json). Using the "context" package, client.go will have a maximum timeout of 300ms to receive the result from server.go.

- The 3 contexts should return an error in the logs if the execution time is insufficient.

- Client.go will have to save the current dollar rate in a "dollar_rate.txt" file in the format: Dollar: {value}

- The necessary endpoint generated by server.go for this challenge will be: /dollar_rate and the port to be used by the http server will be 8080.
